Update 29 March 

The YAML file show different ways to load S (as well as many other parameters) in SeisSol

With ASAGI: 

stress_field_aochi58_ASAGI.yaml
le-teil_stress_seissol_f4.nc (netCDF file stored sig_zz and S)


With built-in FunctionMAP: 

stress_field_d58_p1.yaml (fit S with polynomial degree = 1)
stress_field_d58_p2.yaml (fit S with polynomial degree = 2)
